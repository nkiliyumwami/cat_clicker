The purpose of this project was to create an image and when you click on the image, the number of clicks increase.
We first create an index.html and css.
The big part was javascript with eventlistener and function

Then comes the change of requirement which is obvious in web development, now we will have two cats, cat name and number of clicks... and much more.
